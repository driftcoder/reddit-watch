# Reddit Watch

This node.js script continually watches specified subreddit and prints new posts to terminal.

I wrote this specifically for MacOS iTerm2. If there is enough interest I might work on compatibility with other terminals.

## Requirements
- Node.js

## First run
`npm install` will install all required dependencies

## How to use
`npm start [subreddit name]`
